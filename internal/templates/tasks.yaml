# Tasks Definition Template
# Define your epic and tasks here
# The orchestrator will work through tasks in order

epic:
  id: "EPIC-1" # Unique identifier (used for branch names)
  name: "Example Feature Epic" # Human-readable description

  tasks:
    # Task 1: Feature implementation
    - id: "EPIC-1-001"
      type: "feature" # feature | bugfix | documentation | manual_review
      status: "TODO" # TODO | IN_PROGRESS | DONE | BLOCKED
      description: "Implement user authentication flow"
      acceptance_criteria:
        - "User can register with email/password"
        - "User can log in and receive JWT token"
        - "Protected routes return 401 when not authenticated"
        - "Unit tests cover auth logic"

    # Task 2: Another feature
    - id: "EPIC-1-002"
      type: "feature"
      status: "TODO"
      description: "Add password reset functionality"
      acceptance_criteria:
        - "User can request password reset via email"
        - "Reset link expires after 1 hour"

        - "Tests verify reset flow"

# Notes:
# - The orchestrator will bootstrap project-state.yaml from this file on first run
# - Tasks are executed in order (top to bottom)
# - After all feature tasks complete, KB synthesis runs automatically (unless kb_enabled: false)
# - Each task creates an atomic commit with CHANGELOG entry
# - Bugfix tasks interrupt the current task which will resume after completion
