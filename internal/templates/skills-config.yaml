# Skills Configuration
# Maps task types to Claude Code skill names
#
# This file allows you to customize which skills are used for different task types.
# You can add custom task types and map them to custom skills you create.
#
# Default mappings (do not modify unless you want different behavior):
skill_mappings:
  # Feature implementation workflow
  feature: implement-feature

  # Bug fix workflow (usually auto-created when bugs are discovered)
  bugfix: implement-bugfix

  # Documentation synthesis from session logs
  documentation: implement-documentation

  # Manual review checkpoint (requires human intervention)
  manual_review: manual-review

# Add your custom task types below:
# Examples:
#
#   # Custom refactoring workflow
#   refactor: implement-refactor
#
#   # Security audit workflow
#   security-audit: security-scan-and-report
#
#   # Performance optimization workflow
#   performance: performance-optimization
#
# After adding a custom type:
# 1. Create the skill file: .claude/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md
# 2. Add tasks to tasks.yaml with the new type
# 3. Run: ./agent_loop <max_iterations>
