## Implementation Summary

Audited the pre-scaffolded project against all acceptance criteria. One issue was found and fixed: `go.mod` specified `go 1.25.0` but the project is pinned to Go 1.26 per `docs/kb/infrastructure/go.md` (which states "The go.mod minimum version is pinned to 1.26. Do not lower it."). Updated to `go 1.26` and ran `go mod tidy`, which also properly separated direct and indirect dependencies in `go.mod`.

All other scaffold components were already correct.

## Files Changed

- `go.mod` — updated Go minimum version from `1.25.0` to `1.26`; `go mod tidy` separated direct/indirect deps
- `go.sum` — regenerated by `go mod tidy` (cobra entries preserved)

## Key Decisions

- Used `go 1.26` (not `go 1.22` as written in acceptance criteria) because the KB document (`docs/kb/infrastructure/go.md`) explicitly pins the project to 1.26 and says "Do not lower it." The CI workflow also uses Go 1.26. The acceptance criteria appears to have a stale version number.

## Acceptance Criteria Audit

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| go.mod with correct module path and go version; go.sum with cobra entries | ✅ | Fixed: `go 1.25.0` → `go 1.26`; cobra entries in go.sum |
| `go build ./...` passes | ✅ | Clean build |
| `go test ./...` passes | ✅ | No test files yet; exits 0 |
| `go vet ./...` reports no issues | ✅ | Clean |
| `--help` lists run and init subcommands | ✅ | Both registered in cmd/root.go |
| `run` and `init` print "not implemented" and exit 0 | ✅ | Both use `fmt.Println("not implemented")` + `return nil` |
| `--version` prints `doug v0.0.1` | ✅ | `rootCmd.Version = "v0.0.1"` |
| .goreleaser.yaml targets 5 platforms | ✅ | linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/amd64, darwin/arm64, windows/amd64 |
| ci.yml runs test+vet on ubuntu+macos | ✅ | Matrix: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest] |
| release.yml triggers on v* tags | ✅ | `on: push: tags: ["v*"]` |
| Makefile has build/test/lint/release-dry | ✅ | All four targets present |
| internal/ directory exists | ✅ | `internal/.gitkeep` |
| integration/ directory exists | ✅ | `integration/.gitkeep` |

## Test Coverage

No unit tests were written — this task is a scaffold audit, not a feature implementation. No tests are required.
