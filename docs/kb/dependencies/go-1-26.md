# Go 1.26

## Overview

Go 1.26 is the language runtime and compiler for doug. Released February 10, 2026. Minimum version pinned in `go.mod`.

## Version

```
go 1.26
```

Check your local version:

```bash
go version   # must output go1.26.x or higher
```

## Install / Upgrade

Download from [go.dev/dl](https://go.dev/dl/) or via a version manager:

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install go

# Direct install (all platforms)
# Download the installer for your platform from https://go.dev/dl/
```

After upgrading, run `go mod tidy` to ensure `go.sum` is consistent with the new toolchain.

## Release Notes Summary (1.26)

| Change                                | Impact on doug                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Green Tea GC now default              | Free perf win on YAML struct allocations         |
| `new(expression)` syntax              | Cleaner optional pointer fields in state structs |
| `go fix` rewritten as modernizer      | Run periodically to keep idioms current          |
| Stack-allocated slice backing stores  | Cheaper short-lived slices in hot loop           |
| ~30% faster small allocations (<512B) | Free win for struct-heavy orchestrator code      |
| ~30% faster cgo calls                 | Not directly relevant (doug has no cgo)          |

## Upgrade Policy

Doug follows the two most recent stable Go releases. When Go 1.27 ships, 1.25 drops off support. At that point:

1. Update `go.mod` minimum version
2. Run `go fix ./...` to apply any new modernizers
3. Run `go test ./...` and `go vet ./...`
4. Update this file and `infrastructure/go.md`
